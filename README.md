# Dicee
This is my take on the Dicee challenge from the App Brewery's bootcamp. Each click of the "Let's Roll" button will trigger the set of dice to roll two new random numbers and the player with the higher number wins. This can be used as a fun game or proxy coin toss to decide who wins in an argument. I followed along with the tutorial trying to build out sections on my own prior to being shown the instructor's method.
